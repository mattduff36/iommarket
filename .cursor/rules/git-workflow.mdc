# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

**Types:** feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

**Examples:**
- `feat: add user authentication`
- `fix: resolve race condition in market search`
- `refactor: extract validation logic to utils`
- `docs: update API documentation`
- `test: add unit tests for trading module`

## Commit Best Practices

- Keep commits small and focused
- Write descriptive messages (why, not what)
- Don't commit secrets or debug code
- Run tests before committing
- Review your diff before committing

## Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch (optional)
- `feature/*` - New features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/*` - Code improvements

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:

1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff main...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

## PR Template

```markdown
## Summary
<1-3 bullet points describing the change>

## Changes
- List specific changes made
- Include file paths for significant changes

## Test Plan
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Screenshots (if UI change)
<attach before/after screenshots>
```

## Feature Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan First**
   - Understand requirements fully
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)

3. **Code Review**
   - Self-review your diff
   - Address linting issues
   - Remove debug code

4. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format
   - Push and create PR
