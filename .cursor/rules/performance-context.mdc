# Performance & Context Management

## Model Selection Strategy

Choose the right model for the task:

**Faster/Cheaper Model** (for routine work):
- Simple code generation
- Straightforward edits
- Single-file changes
- Documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes

**More Capable Model** (for complex work):
- Architectural decisions
- Multi-file refactoring
- Complex debugging
- System design
- Security-critical code

## Context Window Management

Be mindful of context limits:

**High Context Sensitivity Tasks:**
- Large-scale refactoring
- Feature implementation spanning multiple files
- Debugging complex interactions
- Multi-step workflows

**Lower Context Sensitivity Tasks:**
- Single-file edits
- Independent utility creation
- Documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes

## Tips for Effective AI Assistance

1. **Be Specific**
   - Provide clear requirements
   - Include relevant file paths
   - Share error messages fully

2. **Work Incrementally**
   - Break large tasks into smaller steps
   - Verify each step before continuing
   - Commit frequently

3. **Provide Context**
   - Reference relevant files with @mentions
   - Explain the "why" not just the "what"
   - Share constraints and requirements

4. **Use Structured Prompts**
   - Reference command templates when available
   - Use checklists for complex tasks
   - Ask for plans before implementation

## Build Troubleshooting

If build fails:

1. Read the full error message
2. Identify the specific file and line
3. Check for common issues:
   - Missing imports
   - Type mismatches
   - Syntax errors
4. Fix incrementally
5. Verify after each fix

## Performance Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] No N+1 queries
- [ ] Proper caching implemented
- [ ] Images optimized
- [ ] Bundle size reasonable
- [ ] Lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Database indexes on frequent queries
